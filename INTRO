My name is Taeyoung Kim who is the second-year PhD student in computer
science major. I'm doing TA for undergrad laboratory class in this
quarter, but I got the conditional pass for my speak test, so I had to
take this English class. I'm a father of two sons, the first one is 5
years-old and second one is 1 years old. I was 7 years industry
experience for my area and 2 years lecturer experience in my
country. One day, I did quit my job and came back to grad school for
my phd program to be a professor which is my future goal.
My research area is an embedded system design. The embedded system is
a computer system with a dedicated function within a large mechanical
or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints [1].
